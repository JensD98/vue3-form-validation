> Easy to use Form Validation for Vue 3

A working prototype is currently available and can be used.

```bash
npm i vue3-form-validation
```

Validation is async and is utilising `Promise.allSettled()`, which has not yet reached cross-browser stability ([see](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled)).
Example usage can be found in this [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/vue-3-form-validation-demo-busd9).
